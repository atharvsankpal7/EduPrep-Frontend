<context>
You're building a landing page for "EduPrep" - a platform for online education. The company targets students and teachers. They differentiate through their unique approach to learning and their commitment to quality education.

The landing page will be the primary conversion funnel for leads.
</context>

<design_philosophy>
Create a design that would win design awards. Avoid the "AI slop" aesthetic at all costs:
- NO purple/blue gradients on white backgrounds
- NO generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui)
- NO predictable hero-CTA-features-testimonials templates
- NO generic geometric shapes or abstract blobs
- NO stock-looking imagery or clichéd visuals
</design_philosophy>

<aesthetic_direction>
Choose ONE distinctive aesthetic approach and commit fully:

Option A: <aesthetic_approach_A>
Option B: <aesthetic_approach_B>
Option C: <aesthetic_approach_C>
Option D: <aesthetic_approach_D>
Option E: <aesthetic_approach_E>

Pick the most unexpected yet appropriate choice and execute it with conviction.
</aesthetic_direction>

<required_sections>
Build these sections with creative interpretation:

1. **Hero Section**
   - A hook that creates immediate intrigue
   - Interactive element that demonstrates capability
   - Clear value proposition in ≤12 words
   - Primary CTA: "<primary_cta>"
   - Trust signals (logos, security badges)

2. **Problem/Solution Narrative**
   - Tell a story, don't list features
   - Use scroll-triggered reveals for dramatic effect
   - Include real-world scenario visualization

3. **Product Showcase**
   - Interactive demo preview or animated mockup
   - Show the product in action visually
   - Technical credibility indicators

4. **Social Proof**
   - Testimonials from target personas
   - Metrics that matter to <target_audience>
   - Customer grid with hover states

5. **Technical Differentiators**
   - Clean comparison or feature grid

6. **Conversion Section*
   - Secondary CTA with urgency
   - Quick form (Name, Email, Company)
   - Alternative action: "<secondary_cta>"

7. **Footer**
   - Minimal, sophisticated
   - Essential links only
   - Newsletter capture
</required_sections>

<technical_requirements>
- use next.js with client side rendering
- Mobile-responsive (fluid typography, adaptive layouts)
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Page load animations with staggered reveals (use animation-delay)
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered effects
- Micro-interactions on hover states
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Performance-optimized (no heavy libraries)
- Load Google Fonts for typography
</technical_requirements>

<motion_design>
Implement these animation principles:
- **Page Load**: Orchestrated reveal sequence (0ms → 200ms → 400ms stagger)
- **Scroll**: Fade-in-up with subtle parallax on key visuals
- **Hover**: Scale transforms, color transitions, underline animations
- **Interactive**: Cursor-following effects, magnetic buttons
- **Background**: Subtle ambient motion (floating particles, gradient shifts)
</motion_design>

<color_guidance>
If you choose a dark theme:
- Deep background: #0a0a0f to #12121a range
- Text: Pure white (#ffffff) for headlines, muted (#a0a0a0) for body
- Accent: ONE bold color used sparingly (electric cyan, hot coral, acid green)

If you choose a light theme:
- Background: Off-white or cream (not pure white)
- Text: Deep charcoal (not pure black)
- Accent: Bold, unexpected (terracotta, forest, sapphire)
</color_guidance>

<typography_direction>
Pick a distinctive combination:
- Headlines: Display serif (Playfair Display) or Geometric sans (Clash Display, Cabinet Grotesk)
- Body: Readable with character (Source Serif Pro, Satoshi)
- Mono: JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono for technical elements

Avoid at all costs: Inter, Roboto, Arial, SF Pro, Open Sans
</typography_direction>

<output_format>
Deliver a single, complete HTML file that:
1. Opens immediately in any browser with no dependencies
2. Contains all CSS in a <style> tag
3. Contains all JavaScript in a <script> tag
4. Uses realistic placeholder content (not "Lorem ipsum")
5. Is production-ready quality
</output_format>

<thinking_process>
Before coding, briefly outline:
1. Which aesthetic direction you're choosing and why
2. The specific font pairing
3. The color palette (hex values)
4. The hero hook concept
5. One unique interactive element you'll implement

Then build the complete page.
</thinking_process>


Production-grade and functional
Visually striking and memorable
Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
Meticulously refined in every detail
Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines
Focus on:

Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
Spatial Composition: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
Backgrounds & Visual Details: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.



Remember: you are is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
